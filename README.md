The main idea of this project is not only to make a Deep learning Neural Network for just this one project, but also a personal framework for other projects, which can be imported for any use.


Although it is not super efficient, and I should probably just use Tensorflow, I am happy with the results.

From testing, I found that it can approximate adding 2 + 2 with only 4 pieces of training data, for which I call this a success.

I do still want to eventually update this to use stochastic gradient descent, but I am finished with this for now.
